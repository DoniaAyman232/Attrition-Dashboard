Human Resources Report on Attrition Reasons
The Challenge
In our organization, we faced a significant challenge with employee attrition, with 711 out of 4410 employees resigning. To understand the reasons behind this, we embarked on a journey to analyze our HR data using Power BI.

Unveiling Insights
As we delved into the data, we discovered some surprising insights. Contrary to popular belief, salary was not the primary driver of resignations. Employees who resigned were often located near the workplace, indicating that proximity to work may not be as significant a factor as previously thought.

Understanding Demographics
Analyzing demographic factors revealed interesting trends. Employees in the younger age range (18-29) were more likely to resign, possibly due to a desire for career exploration and new challenges. Single employees exhibited higher attrition rates, suggesting a higher inclination towards career mobility.

Identifying Key Factors
Several key factors emerged as contributors to attrition. Newer employees with less than 10 years of experience were more likely to resign, as were those who traveled frequently or had high absence rates. Certain departments and job roles, such as Sales executives and laboratory technicians, also showed higher attrition rates.

The Path Forward
Armed with these insights, we are now equipped to take proactive measures to address attrition. By enhancing employee satisfaction, increasing job involvement, improving work-life balance, and providing continuous training, we aim to reduce attrition rates and maintain a motivated workforce.

Our Commitment
This report is a testament to our commitment to understanding our employees' needs and creating a positive work environment where everyone can thrive.
